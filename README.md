dev-toolbox-util-api
=====================

Utility methods for arrays. The goal of this library is to avoid importing larger ones (like apache-commons for example) just for a few classes that do similar things.

The methods in this module are mostly designed to help improve the code readability more than the performances.
If performance is an issue, you can probably find alternatives that are better suited for your use case.
